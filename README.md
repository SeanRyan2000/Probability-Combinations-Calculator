# Probability-Combinations-Calculator
Calculator to calculate the probability of an event occuring x times out of n events 

to change the values that the calculator is using simply change the field in main
"calculate(20, 7, 0.4);" to any numbers in the format "calculate(x, y, z);"
x = the number of times the event will be tested for
y = the number of times you are testing for it to occur atleast that amount of times
z = the probability of success

example:
if 40% of people have facebook and you randomly select 20, what is the probability that 
atleast 7 of the selected people will have facebook

Here you would input calculate(20, 7, 0.4);

I have used a recursive algorithm for the factorial function
